    "### <center> What is Counterstrike: Global Offensive?</center>\n",
    "Counterstrike: Global Offensive - or CS:GO for short - is a multiplayer first-person shooter game with millions of active players. In a game of CS:GO, players compete to kill the opposing team in a virtual shootout while trying to complete objectives like planting or defusing a bomb. While the game itself is fairly competitive, it also boasts a large professional scene where the top players compete in five person teams to be the best in the world. Major tournaments take place almost every week, leading to a constant trove of player data and game statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Player skill\n",
    "While there is often a clear consensus of which teams are the best during a given time period, the individual skill of players within these teams is often hard to connect to actual team performance: for example a team which has the consensus best player in the world at the time, Vitality, is currently ranked second behind Heroic, a team which has only a single player in the top 20 players of 2022. In a game like CS:GO, an individual's performance is often the deciding factor between winning and losing a match. When star players have slumps, there often seems to be a clear impact on team performance, leading to much criticism from the public.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Public opinion can often be a misrepresentation of the actual performance of public figures. In this analysis, we aim to determine whether the public perception that a player is either at the top of their game or on their way out is actually reality, or just something that people like to overemphasize.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <center> Data Collection\n",
    "In order to perform our analysis, we will pull data from 3 different sources.  First will be the raw player data itself. The only source that keeps player level statistics for all CS:GO pro games is hltv.org, a forum devoted to following the game.\n",
    "The second data source we will be looking at is team ranking over time from esl.tv, a website devoted to ranking teams based on tournament wins. Each day the ESL api is updated with team rankings, making it extremely easy to scrape.\n",
    "The last data source we used was from liquipedia.net, a wikipedia like website that provides information on CS:GO players. In CS:GO, players have different roles depending on which kind of weapon they use the most.  Since these roles heavily skew performance, liquipedia was used to determine which role each player had."

In order to access the player data, we use Selenium, which fully emulates a browser. From hltv, we scrape a list of all CS:GO players, as well as performance statistics like kills and deaths for every pro CS:GO game ever played by visiting every player page. This step takes by far the longest, at around 3 hours to run even when multithreaded. For convenience, predownloaded pages are stored in the /scraped pages directory."
